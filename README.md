Praphrase Identification System for Malayalam
I have reproduced <Dynamic Pooling And Unfolding Recursive Autoencoders For Paraphrase Detection> for Malayalam using different embedding techniques and different dimensional vectors
Embeddings used- Word2vec, Glove, FastText embeddings. 
A performance comparitive study using 100,200,300 dimensional vectors.

# Paraphrase-Identification-System-for-Malayalam
---Praphrase Identification System for Malayalam
---I have reproduced <Dynamic Pooling And Unfolding Recursive Autoencoders For Paraphrase Detection> for Malayalam using different embedding techniques and different dimensional vectors
---Embeddings used- Word2vec, Glove, FastText embeddings. 
---A performance comparitive study using 100,200,300 dimensional vectors.
